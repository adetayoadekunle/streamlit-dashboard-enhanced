## Description of the Dashboard

I ended up using the same dataset that was provided by the class because I thought it still provided enough good information about school learning that was interesting to me. The first thing I did was filtering the data by the zipcode by clicking on the dashboard and seeing the rows or data aligned with the zipcode. A data table to explain the filtered data by zip code was created as well. In terms of descriptive summary, I looked at different things such as total weeks of data, total students, and zip codes that were distinctive. There was a bar chart to show total students each week and another descriptive to find the average students from each district.
